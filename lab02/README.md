## Lab 02 - Into the world of containers

### Objectives
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate three different concepts of containers in the Arquillian ecosystem:

* Embedded (such as Glassfish 3.1 from the previous lab
* Managed
* Remote

### Task

* Add additional Maven profiles (could be done using [JBoss Forge Arquillian Plugin](https://github.com/forge/plugin-arquillian))
   * JBoss AS 7.0.2.Final Managed
   * JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final Remote (server already added to Eclipse in the VM, needs to be started before running the tests)
* Play around with the environment (i.e. run JBoss Remote in debug mode and set few breakpoints)
