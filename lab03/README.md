## Lab 03 - Testing persitence layer done right

### Objectives

In this lab you will learn how to simplify tests where Persistence Layer is involved. Instead of relying on hand-written, tedious database fixture you will use DBUnit-based datasets to seed your database.

### Task

Your task is to replace already create "repository" test (from lab1) with Arquillian Persistence Extension and define dataset (eg. YAML, XML or JSON) instead of test fixture written directly in the test code.
